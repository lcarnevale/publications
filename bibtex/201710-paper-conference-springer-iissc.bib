  abstract    = "Nowadays, we are observing a massive digitalization of clinical tasks in Hospital Information Systems (HIS). Even more medical devices belongs to Internet of Things (IoT) applications that generate a huge amount of clinical data. Therefore, the healthcare industry is looking at modern big data storage, processing and analytics technologies. In this context, traditional HIS presents several issues, such as a mismanagement of data generated from medical devices. Starting from the experience of IRCCS Centro Neurolesi ``Bonino Pulejo'' placed in Messina (Italy), i.e., a clinical and research center, in this paper, we motivate the need to move traditional HIS into an innovative infrastructure based on the Osmotic computing paradigm. In particular, studying the healthcare domain, we specifically focus on production and research tasks.",
