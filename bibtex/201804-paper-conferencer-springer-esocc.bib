  abstract    = "Ocean data management plays an important role in the oceanographic problems, such as ocean acidification. These data, having different physical, biological and chemical nature, are collected from all seas and oceans of the world, generating an international networks for standardizing data formats and facilitating global databases exchange. Cloud computing is therefore the best candidate for oceanographic data migration on a distributed and scalable platform, able to help researchers for performing future predictive analysis. In this paper, we propose a new Cloud based workflow solution for storing oceanographic data and ensuring a good user experience about the geographical data visualization. Experiments prove the goodness of the proposed system in terms of performance.",
