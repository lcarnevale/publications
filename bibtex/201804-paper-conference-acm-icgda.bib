  abstract    = "Nowadays, thanks to new technologies, we are observing an explosion of data in different fields such as clinical, environmental and so on. In this context, a typical example of the well-known Big Data problem is represented by visualization. In this work, we propose an innovative platform for managing the oceanographic acquisitions. More specifically, we present two innovative visualization techniques: general overview and site specific observation. Experiments prove the goodness of the proposed system in terms both of performance and user experience.",
