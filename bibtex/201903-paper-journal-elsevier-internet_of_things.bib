  abstract    = "Nowadays, the latest technological advancements have changed the centralized Cloud Computing model, going through Edge and Internet of Things (IoT), which are closer to end users. In particular, current Cloud Computing programming models deal with the recent evolution of the IoT phenomenon because smart devices are becoming more and more pervasive, powerful and inexpensive. Therefore, services need to be placed near such devices and resource orchestration techniques need to be redesigned. In this regard, Osmotic Computing aims at providing a new computing paradigm based on the deployment and migration strategies related to the infrastructures and applications requirements across Cloud, Edge, and IoT layers. The objective of this scientific work is to propose an Osmotic Computing architecture, based on a multi-agent system, according to a new software abstraction called MicroELement (MEL), that encapsulates resources, services and data necessary to run IoT applications. A Body Area Network (BAN) scenario is proposed in order to explore the Osmotic Computing potentiality and explain the reasons behind this new paradigm."
