  abstract="Nowadays, healthcare is facing Big Data processing in order to support medical staff by means of decision making tools. In this context, a challenging topic is the storing and analysis of data in the cardiology field. Electrocardiogram produces signals about the heart health that need to be processed in order to detect a possible disorder. In this paper, we discuss an Apache Spark based tool and that uses the Menard algorithm. In order to validate our solution, we performed experiments on a use case in which the algorithm has been implemented in order to detect heart disorder. Experiments prove the goodness of our approach in terms of performance.",
